# codingAcademy
```
codingAcademy is my ICSG project which is a club that 
teaches coding internationally. The progress of each student 
can be seen, but no personal informations are made public.
```

## further explanation
```
Though they are in Korean, codingAcademy can provide some 
interesting coding tests, and pop quizes. If needed, please 
use them.
```

## Plan for further teaching
```
No plans yet! But please email me for further teaching! 
If you'd like to be taught, mail me.
