# codingAcademy
```
codingAcademy is my ICSG project which is a club that 
teaches coding internationally. The progress of each 
student can be seen, but no personal informations are 
made public.
```

## further explanation
```
Though they are in Korean, codingAcademy can provide 
some interesting coding tests, and pop quizes. If 
needed, please use them.
```

## Plan for further teaching
```
The ICSG project has closed due to difficult time
management of the other highschool students, and 
college workload of my own.
```

## Reflection
```
The ICSG project, in my opinion, was a project that
gave me an idea of how I can handle my time and
share the knowledge of CS that I have gained with
others. For sure, I was not able to achieve my goal
of "Enlighten others in the field of CS." Rather, I
myself gained knowledge of how I can efficiently
convey my opinions to others, plan for classes, and
construct a syllabus for learning. I feel sorry for
my former students as they must have suffered from
my inability to utilize the knowledge I learned
later on. I thank them on every aspects as they
were my source of learning. Thereby, the ICSG
project will be kept closed while our lives go on.
